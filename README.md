## About the Video Course
This course is a gentle yet thorough introduction to Data Science, Statistics and R using real life examples. Letâ€™s parse that. Gentle, yet thorough: This course does not require a prior quantitative or mathematics background. It starts by introducing basic concepts such as the mean, median etc. and eventually covers all aspects of an analytics (or) data science career from analyzing and preparing raw data to visualizing your findings. Data Science, Statistics and R: This course is an introduction to Data Science and Statistics using the R programming language. It covers both the theoretical aspects of Statistical concepts and the practical implementation using R. Real life examples: Every concept is explained with the help of examples, case studies and source code in R wherever necessary. The examples cover a wide array of topics and range from A/B testing in an Internet company context to the Capital Asset Pricing Model in a quant finance context.
